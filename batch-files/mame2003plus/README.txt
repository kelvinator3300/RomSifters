Drop these files in your rom folder and refresh. Because they start with numbers
They should bubble up to the top of your file-list. The numbers correspond to the
order in which you should run them. For example, run '000 MOVE MQRT.bat' first.
Next, run '010 MOVE CLONES.bat'. Files starting with '999' are optional and the
order in which you run them shouldn't matter.
