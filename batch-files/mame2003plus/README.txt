Drop these files in your rom folder and refresh. Because they start with numbers
They should bubble up to the top of your file-list. The numbers correspond to the
order in which you should run them. For example, run '000 MOVE MQRT.bat' first.
Next, run '010 MOVE CLONES.bat'. Files starting with '999' are optional and the
order in which you run them shouldn't matter.

#Sparta.bat is an alternative to all of the above. Place it in your rom folder 
that contains ALL of the roms. Run it and it will create a 'Sparta' folder with 
around 300+ roms hand-picked by me and various 'Best arcade games' lists on the net.
